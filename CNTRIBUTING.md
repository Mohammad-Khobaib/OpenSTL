## Implementing Data Structures

We encourage contributors to implement new data structures and algorithms in OpenSTL. Enhancing our collection of data structures not only expands the utility of the library but also enriches the learning and collaboration experience for everyone involved.

### How to Contribute

1. **Choose a Data Structure:**
   - Explore the existing data structures in the project (`/include/OpenSTL`) or suggest a new one.

2. **Implement the Data Structure:**
   - Write clear and efficient code following the Google C++ Style Guide (outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

3. **Include Tests:**
   - Ensure comprehensive testing of the data structure implementation.
   - Write unit tests using Google Test in the `/test` directory to validate functionality and edge cases.

4. **Submit Your Contribution:**
   - Follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request (PR).

### Example Contributions

- Implementing a new container such as a priority queue, hash table, or AVL tree.
- Optimizing existing data structures for performance or memory usage.

### Why Contribute to Data Structures?

- **Learning Opportunity:** Enhance your understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Community Impact:** Your contribution helps improve the utility and versatility of OpenSTL for all users.
- **Collaboration:** Engage with the community and receive feedback to improve your coding skills.

### Get Started!

Choose a data structure that interests you and start coding! We look forward to your contributions and appreciate your effort in making OpenSTL a robust library for C++ developers.
